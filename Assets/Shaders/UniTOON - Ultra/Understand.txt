UniTOON - Ultra
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// UniTOON - Ultra is a work in progress, you will continue to freely get updates as they progress.
// UniTOON - Ultra is in her infancy, I promise to you I will continue working on UniTOON
// To make this a great asset for any of your games!

// UniTOON strives to be different than normal toon shaders that might have a bit of a bump map,
// we are taking this to the next level to allow for optimalistic realistic cartoon graphics.
// there is nothing wrong with cel-shading it's self, but it could be better.
// I am a big fan of cel-shading, but there has to be more to it than just solid colors.

// UniTOON is here to suffice for the lack of features.
// UniTOON will allow the use of full on contact of normal maps, specular maps, rim shading with specular
// and normal maps all combined (also now with Parrallax Mapping techniques!)

// This set of Shaders should be 100% compatible in DX11 Mode now, if you run into any problems where the
// Shader turn a purple or pink like color, please review the contact page and please forward
// the error from the console log to me so I can get this working asap!
//
// Thank you so much for your purchase, hope you enjoy!
